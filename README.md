# Fast-IPFS

Fast IPFS is C data oriented implementation of IPFS that aims multi Gigabytes per second speeds.

It's mostly also me wanting to write some more C code.

# Safety / Consistenty

This is not a goal, I agree that RCE and memory corruptions are an issue but the code is written to see some sweet high numbers.

I'm not a good C programer, be aware this software has bugs.

# Requirement

- Linux >= 5.3
